The answer is different for each student who asks it. That’s because a thoughtful and tailored approach to affordability includes family savings and various forms of financial assistance. First-time freshmen and transfer students: Use our Net Price Calculator for a customized financial snapshot that includes potential financial aid and scholarships. Net Price Calculator Current students: Use this Tuition and Fees Tool to calculate an estimate of costs for KU's various degree programs. Calculate Costs For the most up-to-date and accurate information about  tuition and fees, please refer to the Comprehensive Fee Schedule . To determine your on-campus housing and meal charges, go to KU Housing's Rates page . Cost of Attendance Your estimated Cost of Attendance (COA) , also known as a budget, is a standardized estimate of what it will cost you to attend KU for the academic year. Your financial aid package cannot exceed your estimated COA. An estimated COA contains the following components: Tuition All KU resident and nonresident students pay a per-credit-hour rate. Since standard tuition rates are set annually by the Kansas Board of Regents, future standard tuition rates are unknown. Fees Required campus fees are paid by all students to support services and programs such as health, recreation, transportation, and student activities. Course fees are additional per-credit-hour charges that vary by school to support academic programs and instruction in that specific school. Additionally, programs such as engineering, law, and pharmacy include special or differential fees. Food and housing KU Student Housing offers a range of options and rates, and Financial Aid & Scholarships can offer estimates of the cost of living in the Lawrence area no matter what living option a student chooses. Books, course materials, supplies, equipment, transportation, and miscellaneous expenses Materials estimates vary by school. Other expenses are given a flat estimate annually by FAS. COA adjustments Adjustment of a COA may be possible if your costs increase due to one or more of the following non-discretionary expenses: Medical/dental/disability expenses for the student Child care Technology Additional required educational expenses Additional transportation expenses Housing costs and/or food and shelter for dependents Other Adjustment allows for but does not guarantee that additional financial aid will be awarded. If your request results in increased eligibility for aid, you may receive additional assistance if funds are available and seek increased loans (except for Federal Direct loans, which are limited in amount by federal regulation). However, if reduced eligibility for financial aid results, the repayment, cancellation, or reduction of aid may be required. Budget adjustment requests are evaluated only after the original FAFSA and all supporting documents have been reviewed. Evaluation may take two to three weeks. To request a budget adjustment, log in to the FAFSA portal for KU and click the “Request” button. 1502 Building 1502 Iowa St. Lawrence, KS 66045 Bus Routes: A, B, and C financialaid@ku.edu 785-864-4700 facebook twitter youtube Contact Visit KU KU Admissions KU Endowment KU News KU Events KU Careers KU Alumni Association Nondiscrimination statement Accessibility | Website support | CMS login © 2025 The University of Kansas The University of Kansas is a public institution governed by the Kansas Board of Regents.",https://affordability.ku.edu/costs
